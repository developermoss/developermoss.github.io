            <h3>Qualified Teacher | Software Developer</h3>
            <p>2015 was a tough year academically. Despite being a strong Maths student and quickly grasping concepts, I only managed to achieve 63% in my final Maths exam. This result wasn't satisfactory, so I decided to take a gap year and work at Douglas SEDC in 2016. This experience not only provided me with valuable work experience but also allowed me to dedicate more time to studying Maths. The hard work paid off, as I was able to significantly improve my Maths skills and achieve a commendable 73% in my re-write exam.
                <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br /><br />I was always a bit of a loner, preferring to keep to myself. However, my year at SEDC in 2016 was a turning point. It really boosted my self-confidence and helped me develop my social skills. It felt like a switch had been flipped within me.
                    I started to enjoy interacting with people and even considered a career in teaching. So much so that I asked if I could stay on as a teaching assistant while pursuing my Systems Development Diploma through Boston College. By this time, it was clear to everyone that I was growing as an individual, and they were happy to support my continued development.
                    
                    <br /><br />After completing my diploma in 2020, I realized my passion for teaching and expressed my desire to continue my studies towards a PGCE. I also requested a transfer to Prieska to take on the role of Senior Teaching Assistant. I was excited about the opportunity to run the afternoon FET classes for Gariep High School and contribute to the education of the students there.
                    I quickly won the support of the learners and became a very valued assistant to Mrs. Van Heerden. I also took the initiative to organize annual Maths camps for Grade 12 students and was capable of managing them independently.
                    When Peter Maree, the Prieska team leader, resigned at the end of 2023, I was offered the position, having by then qualified as a full-qualified teacher. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances involving the loss of our main sponsor, we had to retrench our staff, including me, at the end of March 2024.
                    
                    <br /><br />After returning to Douglas, I focused my time on developing a Maths application and assisting Douglas SEDC with creating their website. When the opportunity arose to support Weslaan High School as a Maths teacher assistant, I eagerly accepted.
                    I was aware of Mr. Wellen's health challenges and wanted to contribute to alleviating the pressure on the school and the Maths learners. While I am currently pursuing formal qualifications in Maths at an accredited educational institution, I am confident in my abilities to fulfill the role of a Maths teacher.
                    
                    <br /><br />I am able to break down complex mathematical concepts into simpler terms, making them easier for learners to understand. I pride myself on my calm and reliable demeanor, and I am always eager to do my best. I enjoy building positive relationships with learners and believe I have a promising future in education.
                    My strong IT skills are a valuable asset, and I am grateful for the support of Douglas SEDC. I am not afraid to admit when I don't know something and am always willing to seek help. I am confident that with the right opportunities, I can develop into an exceptional Maths teacher.</span></p>
